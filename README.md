- **React** is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable components that can handle state and events. React also supports server-side rendering, which can improve the performance and SEO of the web app.
- **TailwindCSS** is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level classes for styling elements. It enables developers to create custom designs without writing any CSS code. TailwindCSS also has a responsive system that allows developers to adjust the layout and appearance of elements based on the screen size.
- **Sanity** is a headless CMS that allows developers to store and manage content in a structured way. It provides a rich editing environment, a powerful query language, and a flexible API. Sanity also integrates well with React and other front-end frameworks.
- **React-Masonry-CSS** is a React component that implements a masonry layout using CSS columns. A masonry layout is a grid-like layout where the elements have different heights and widths, creating a gap-free arrangement. React-Masonry-CSS allows developers to create responsive masonry layouts with minimal configuration.

Pins are visual bookmarks that link to external websites or resources. Users can also comment, like, and share pins with others.
